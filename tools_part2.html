    <h1>Notetaker: GitHub Pages, Homebrew, and VM Machines</h1>

    <h2>GitHub Pages</h2>
    <p>GitHub Pages is a feature on GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.
        It's great for personal websites, project documentation, and more. To set up GitHub Pages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one.</li>
        <li>Go to the repository settings.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.</li>
        <li>Choose the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (e.g., master branch).</li>
        <li>Save the settings, and your site will be live at <code>https://username.github.io/repository</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Homebrew</h2>
    <p>Homebrew is a package manager for macOS and Linux. It simplifies the installation of software and libraries.
        To install Homebrew:</p>
    <pre><code>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    </code></pre>
    <p>After installation, you can use Homebrew to install various packages, e.g., <code>brew install packageName</code>.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Machines (VMs)</h2>
    <p>A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system within another. VMs allow you to run multiple operating
        systems on a single physical machine. Popular VM software includes VirtualBox and VMware. To create a VM:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download and install a virtual machine application like VirtualBox.</li>
        <li>Create a new virtual machine instance.</li>
        <li>Allocate resources like RAM and storage to the VM.</li>
        <li>Install an operating system on the VM, just like you would on a physical machine.</li>
        <li>You can run and manage multiple VMs on your computer, each with its own OS and applications.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These are basic notes on GitHub Pages, Homebrew, and VM Machines. Remember to refer to official documentation for
        detailed instructions and advanced usage.</p>
