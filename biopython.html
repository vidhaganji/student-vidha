    <h1>Biopython API Note</h1>

    <p>
        Biopython is a collection of tools and libraries for computational biology. It provides a wide range of functionalities for tasks such as sequence analysis, structural biology, and phylogenetics.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sequence Handling: Biopython allows you to read, write, and manipulate biological sequence data, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.</li>
        <li>Sequence Analysis: Perform various sequence analyses, such as sequence alignment, motif search, and translation.</li>
        <li>Structure Analysis: Work with structural data, including PDB file parsing, structure alignment, and structure visualization.</li>
        <li>Phylogenetics: Biopython provides tools for constructing and analyzing phylogenetic trees.</li>
        <li>File Format Support: It supports various file formats commonly used in bioinformatics, such as FASTA, GenBank, BLAST, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example of Usage</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example of using Biopython to read and manipulate a DNA sequence:</p>
    <pre>
from Bio import Seq

# Create a DNA sequence
dna_sequence = Seq.Seq("AGCTGATCGATCGATC")

# Calculate the reverse complement
reverse_complement = dna_sequence.reverse_complement()

print("Original Sequence: ", dna_sequence)
print("Reverse Complement: ", reverse_complement)
    </pre>

    <h2>InstallationSteps (make sure to use pip!)</h2>
    <pre>
pip install biopython
    </pre>
    <p>Then, you can explore the comprehensive <a href="https://biopython.org/wiki/Documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a> to learn more about its features and how to use them in your bioinformatics projects.</p>

    <p>Biopython is a valuable resource for anyone working in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics. It simplifies many common tasks and provides a platform for custom analysis and research.</p>
